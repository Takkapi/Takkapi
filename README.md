### About me

Hi. I'm Takkapi. I'm 17 years old and I am a small programmer who can't decide what programming language to choose and what programming industry to work on.
I like watching anime, I'm still in highschool and trying to work on a project.
Preffered programming languages: Rust, C++ and C#
